## Usage
1. Run the following loadstring in Roblox:
```luau
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fisiaque/BayaForRoblox/main/loader.lua", true))()
```

## Possible Issues
1. Make sure executor supports file functions and the debug library.
2. Doesnâ€™t use incomplete or custom versions of these functions, which can cause unexpected behavior.
3. Ensuring consistent behavior each time those functions are used.

### User Issues
MAKE SURE GAME IS CLOSED FIRST!
1. Delete the 'Baya' folder.
2. Check your connection to [the main loadstring.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fisiaque/BayaForRoblox/refs/heads/main/loader.lua)
3. Make sure no other scripts are interfering with 'Baya'.
